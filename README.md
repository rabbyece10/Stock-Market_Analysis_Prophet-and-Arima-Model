# Stock-Market_Analysis_Prophet-and-Arima-Model

🧠 Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and forecast stock prices using two powerful time series forecasting techniques: Facebook Prophet and the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The goal is to compare both models in terms of accuracy and usability for predicting future trends in stock prices.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Visualization
statsmodels – ARIMA modeling
fbprophet – Prophet modeling
sklearn – Evaluation metrics

✅ Observations
- Prophet handled seasonality and long-term trends better, making it suitable for extended forecasts.
- ARIMA performed well on short-term predictions after achieving stationarity.
- Prophet’s ease of use and automatic handling of missing values and outliers made it developer-friendly.
- ARIMA required manual preprocessing and parameter tuning, but gave fine-grained control.
